GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "body": " I’ve been through fire and water, I tell you! From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.

When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

Desta forma, ao fazer o uso de virtualização através de contêineres, o curso de computação pode, entre outros fatores, obter vantagens na redução do custo da manutenção dos seus laboratórios, melhorar a preparação dos egressos para o mercado de trabalho e redução em trabalhos burocráticos e rotineiros. Resultados obtidos: Assim, através da aplicação de questionário aos membros da CBSI, foi possível mapear o conhecimento sobre a virtualização utilizando contêineres, as áreas de formação e afinidade de cada um dos membros, as disciplinas que podem fazer uso (imediato ou não) da virtualização e as ferramentas que devem ser trabalhadas em cada uma delas.

Além disso irá contribuir na formação dos alunos do curso de computação para trabalharem com tecnologias em nuvem (cloud) e orquestração de contêineres em ambientes de alta disponibilidade com vistas as demandas do mercado nos próximos anos (CARNEIRO; PAULA, 2017). Por fim, o presente trabalho ajudará a comunidade regional e acadêmica a superar os desafios da computação em nuvem proporcionando um modelo de ambiente de alta disponibilidade para ser executado em laboratórios de informática, de cursos de computação, que faz uso da orquestração da execução de softwares e serviços em contêineres. Objetivo Geral: Elaborar um modelo de ambiente de alta disponibilidade para ser utilizado durante as aulas teóricas e práticas do curso de sistemas de informação através da orquestração da execução de softwares/serviços em contêineres Objetivos Específicos: Para atender o objetivo proposto do trabalho definidos os seguintes objetivos específicos:  Mapear ambientes/ferramentas que proporcionam alta disponibilidade de aplicações utilizadas em sistemas computacionais; Levantamento de ambientes que proporcionem a orquestração de serviços; Mapear o conhecimento do corpo docente e discente do curso a respeito dos conceitos de alta disponibilidade e de orquestração de softwares e/ou serviços; Identificar disciplinas pertencentes ao curso de sistemas de informação, do Campus Lagarto, que permitem fazer uso da plataforma de virtualização em contêineres de forma distribuída através da orquestração; Elaborar manual básico sobre a construção e a configuração de um ambiente que promova alta disponibilidade através da orquestração da execução de softwares/serviços em contêineres. Resultados esperados: Espera-se que este projeto contribua ofertando um modelo de ambiente de alta disponibilidade para ser utilizado durante as aulas teóricas e práticas do curso de sistemas de informação através da orquestração da execução de softwares/serviços em contêineres. Este projeto também favorecerá a distribuição e execução dos softwares criados pelos alunos do curso de sistemas de informação do Instituto Federal de Sergipe - Campus Lagarto, principalmente aqueles que foram elaborados com vistas ao cumprimento das atividades propostas pelas disciplinas mais avançadas, como o Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso (TCC), e que necessitam de um ambiente com grande capacidade computacional. Além disso, contribuirá com a comunidade de pesquisa de SI na resolução do desafio proposto por Carneiro e Paula (2017), ao permitir que futuros trabalhadores na área de tecnologia de informação (alunos do IFS) possam ter uma visão de como funciona um ambiente de alta disponibilidade desde o início da sua formação. Por fim, este projeto irá contribuir significativamente para uma formação de maior qualidade dos alunos envolvidos no projeto, que devem estar matriculados no curso de sistemas de informação, por apresentar e trabalhar com conteúdos que não estão elencados no PPC.

Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists.

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

				<p>There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>

<p>As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.</p>

<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>

<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>strike through</del></li>
  <li>==highlight==</li>
  <li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>

<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code class="highlighter-rouge">like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.</p>

<p><img src="/mediumish-theme-jekyll/assets/images/8.jpg" alt="walking" /></p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
